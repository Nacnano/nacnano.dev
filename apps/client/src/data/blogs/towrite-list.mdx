### I found and learned so many new things from the wanders. Let's note it before I forget. I'll write about them later (If I have time, bruh).

### Here's the list:

1. I should be thinking more about my travel companion. (I was being selfish af.)

2. I love the way the locals live and connect with each others. (Eating บัวลอย ข้างถนน)

3. Opening a hostel might be a very nice idea. (The owner chillingly lives on the first floor.)

4. Remote working and travelling at the same time could fit me. (I tried it and it was fun.)

5. I found A couple kissing in the middle street in front of the Royal Palace. Lol

6. Most people in Thammasat University used English, wtf.

7. I see a lot of sports cars or expensive cars (Ben, BMW) parked in front of sloppy buildings in small alleys.

8. I love walking alongside a canal or a river. It felt so good.

9. Seeing an overwhelming amount of depressing and disturbing content from the Siriraj hospital. Also seeing how advanced our medical knowledge is. (Too long to write them now)

10. I got to talk to a soy milk seller. (Knowing how hard the selling is.)

11. I am so bad at petting dogs. They almost bite me. (I was so scared.)

12. I want to try camping by myself. (There are many foreigners bringing their tents to sleep in the hostel.)

13. Walking alone at night in Bangkok is safer than I thought.

14. I accidentally stared a lot of strangers directly in the eyes thinking they were my friends. (How to memorise people's faces T_T)

15. Old school fashion and design are lovely af. Imagine sitting in place with old but clean and simple furniture (not luxurious ones).

16. Seeing people interacting with others really calms my mind.

17. Idk but Horoscopes are fun though. Maybe I just like deep talking with people.

18. A group of foreigners asked me for directions. I don't know why they chose me. Maybe because of pure luck or I just look like a traveller.

19. My big problem is when I see something nice, I prefer to truly engulf myself in it, resulting in me not touching my phone and not able to record it. That's why I failed to record a lot of things. (This is also the reason why I tried not to use my phone when I am with my friends.)

20. Seeing men hugging each other made my heart skip wtf. That was so cute. Maybe I am gay and I am fine with it.

21. As you can guess, I prefer places with fewer people. The reasons are having chances to talk to the locals and its serenity.

22. When I played football, I saw people listening to online classes while playing (with Siriraj doctors-tobe)

23. ...

#### The list is not finished. New topics will be added as the time goes by.
