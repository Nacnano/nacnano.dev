summary: I had a chance to apply to the King's Scholarship. I realized I was good enough for the scholarship but it was too late.

When I was in my last year of high school, I missed one of the most valuable opportunities of my life. For high school students, there was a scholarship called the King's scholarship provided by the government. Students who received this scholarship had chances to further their studies abroad worldwide. They also were not required to pay back their tuition and living costs.

Because of these reasons, the level of competitiveness and difficulty of getting this scholarship was out of this world.

At first, I was not interested in it because I was nervous about competing against the country's top students. I was wondering whether I had a chance of winning any of them. After thinking for a while, I decided to stop overthinking and started writing application forms. I did not study for the test at all during that time. All I did was play video games and hang out with my friends while knowing other students were practicing extremely hard for the scholarship.

Two months later, the cruel exam period arrived. Of the five subjects I needed to do, there were only mathematics and science that most of the students found challenging. I handled the rest of them well because the questions were trouble-free. On the math part, I surprisingly could solve almost every problem. That was the first moment I realized I could achieve the impossible.

Then brutal reality hit. I was entirely clueless about the chemistry and biology parts of the science exam. Expectedly, I was not qualified for the scholarship. If I had studied, I would have been abroad now. Finally, I could not do anything but feel disappointed in myself.

#### To prevent this from happening again, I learned to always put my best effort into everything.
