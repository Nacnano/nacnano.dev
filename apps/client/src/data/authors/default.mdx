I developed an interest in the field of computers during grade 7. Since grade 8, I've actively participated in numerous computer olympiad camps, acquiring crucial computational thinking and algorithmic skills.

During high school, I conducted a research project focusing on the application of machine learning models to analyze studentsâ€™ learning efficiency, acquiring fundamental knowledge of several model types.

After high school, I landed an internship at two startups (MonkeyEveryday and Wang Data Market) where I undertook various roles such as web developer, data scientist, graphic designer, and business analyst. This experience exposed me to a multitude of tech concepts and familiarized me with the corporate work environment. I also engaged in multiple tech events and contributed to several university projects.

Currently, I'm actively learning new tech stacks and pursuing various side projects as a hobby.
