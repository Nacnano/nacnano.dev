My fascination with computers began around grade 7 of middle school, prompting me to explore various aspects of technology and its applications through projects and competitions during my school years.

Currently pursuing Computer Engineering at Chulalongkorn University, my passion for technology continues to drive me forward.

I enjoy delving into new technological concepts and approaches, while also immersing myself in the vibrant tech community.
